1.Created login on On TMDB wesite.
2.Created API key on the tmdb website,which generated a token.
This token could be used as ?api_key=" " appended in the https link,whenever we make API calls to get the data.
3.I hit 3 API end points: to get few data samples and process the original data.Since I could not make multiple api calls.I limited myself
to few records to do POC.
